The company is recognised for creating work with a distinctive style, both intimate and large scale, commonly a collision of the familiar and the mysterious, often darkly humorous. \"IOU occupies a position in the contemporary arts and performance arena where it is considered to be a model of excellence both nationally and internationally, a position it rightly deserves.

My role in Sierra Leone was to interface with community leaders and aid agencies. Then remained in a civilian role working for the Norwegian Refugee Council as Refugee Camp Manager. Studied a Masters in Environmental Conservation, my research was on the use of a Strategic Environmental Assessment in Post conflict situations. My role in Iraq was as Project Coordinator for the Coalition Provisional Authority, Basra - Agriculture and Irrigation department. The work included a desertification and shelterbelt programme, in part to establish better microclimates and also to look at adaptive farming methods to account for the dryer arid soils.I then went on to work as Programme Coordinator with DAI (Development Alternative Incorporated) for the Iraq Marshes Restoration and Sustainable livelihoods Programme.The project was part of the USAID Programme for Iraq.

Being inspired by the structure and \"inherent\" organisation of Torah Law revealed by the Rambam in his Mishnei Torah, in which subjects are presented in related groups and sets, I have attempted to organise these in a \"graphic\" and spatial way, and using the map as a basic metaphor to describe this structure. I have tried to maintain fully this metaphor at every level in order to raise the visual experience from what could be, a dry and functional diagrammatic representation of facts, to a more interesting, engaging and thought provoking experience. There could be multiple applications for this map, but in the present format I envisage a graphic representation at 3 \"levels\" or \"scales\" of detail. I have used much artistic licence in deciding how to organise the spatial relationships between the subjects of the Mishnei Torah, as well as the textures and characteristics of the â€œterrainâ€? in order to create a \"backdrop\" for its content.

This service provides families with access to our therapy service until their child is 18. They can access the service whenever it is needed at no additional cost to themselves. We provide Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, Mindfulness workshops, TheraplayÂ©, and Paediatric Occupational Therapy assessment. I'm committed to ensuring the agency provides truly effective services in a nurturing and learning environment. I am keen to better understand how effective timely long term therapeutic support can help children and families. I am also interested in Adoptionplus developing relationships with local authorities so that limited resources can be better utilised in the provision of adoption services in the UK. My role at Adoptionplus has centered on the setting up, development and management of all the four services we offer: Placement, Family Therapy, Training and Conferences and Birth Relative Counselling. Additionally, I'm currently writing 2 books. One book I'm co editing with Professor David Howe, regarding Analytical Assessments. This book is due to be published April 2015. The second book is a workbook for children aimed at helping them prepare to move into their adoptive family. This book is being published by Hinton Press in October 2014.

I understand the importance of using anti-static precautions when repairing systems. I attended onsite warranty repairs to Liverpool John Moores University when required. To uphold the reputation of the company, I believe it is important to always address the customer with a professional and friendly manner. I have become familiar with a programme called Acronis True Image, as it is vital to back up any saved files before replacing components. I frequently use programmes such as Check Disk to test hard drives with suspected damaged boot sectors or master boot records. I assess the reliability of the memory using MemTest +86 or Microsoft MemTest, and operate 3D Mark to check how the graphics of a system are functioning. If the system powers on but fails to power on self-test, I use Post Tester to acquire a list of the P.O.S.T codes. I used a program called World Bench which is used to run the system in a user environment without any user input, thus allowing me to work on multiple systems." , "title" : "Computer Hardware Repair Technician" , "start" : "August 2006" , "location" : "Liverpool, United Kingdom" , "duration" : "6 years 4 months" , "organization" : [ { "name" : "CMS COMPUTERS Ltd" , "profile_url" : "http://www.linkedin.com/company/477132"}]}] , "summary" : "â€¢ Resolve Hardware or Software faults over the phone to the general public. â€¢ Support Microsoft Vista / Windows 7 & Microsoft Windows XP. â€¢ Log & check warranty status of users machines â€¢ Guide New users on how to reseat RAM / Graphics Cards / Hard Drives. â€¢ Computer Diagnostics. â€¢ On site support.

The project was completed in March 2014. I enjoyed the high pressure environment of Singapore; the tight deadlines of the commercial developers, the complex Authority submission system and the high quality of work that was demanded there. Hybrid Procurement Route : the Architectural elements were under a Traditional Contractual arrangement while the C&S and M&E portions were under a D&B Contract. This hybrid arrangement ran fairly smoothly, though there were some issues; some M&E items were not included at Tender stage and the contractor had to make some substantial changes while avoiding modifying the residential units as they had all been sold off-plan. I was primarily concerned with the contract administration of the project such as: â€¢ Managing junior staff in the team. â€¢ Issuing AIâ€™s & ADâ€™s, responding to Contractors RFIs and commenting on the Main Contractor and Sub-contractor Shop Drawings. â€¢ Preparing submissions to the many Authority bodies in Singapore. â€¢ Managing NSC Contracts from Tender stage to construction.

Europe and deep inside the Arctic Circle, and back home in just 3 weeks. This saw me ride an average of nearly 300 miles every day for 21 days straight on some of the most challenging roads in Europe. This not only tested my physical strength of riding a 250kg motorbike for 8 hours a day, but also my mental fortitude of riding solo in foreign countries for 3 weeks straight. To date I have raised Â£4,800 for the charity from my ride. The reason I took on this challenge is to raise money for brain injury charity Cerebra. Cerebra have helped my little brother Robbie ever who suffered an acquired brain injury at the age of 9 months old which has left him with severe learning difficulties. They have also provided much needed assistance to my family, especially my mum who has dedicated her life to looking after Robbie.

Due to the unique concept of the website I can not disclose too much information about the project or send my business plan without a signed confidentiality agreement. However, there are a few things I'm willing to disclose about the project. Firstly the company is seeking Â£100â€™000 start up investment for a very unique .COM idea. Â£25-30â€™000 will be spent on the initial design development of the website. Due to the innovative complex nature of the website it will have to be developed by a experienced team of webmasters hence the high quote. Â£50â€™000 will be spent on marketing and advertising, Â£10â€™000 for working capital and Â£10â€™000 for contingency. We aim to market the business throughout the UK, Europe, United States and Japan with an intense ecommerce marketing scheme and ad campaign The first year sales forecast for 2009 are Â£106â€™000 gross profit strictly on sales figures alone. These figures continue to climb reaching Â£600,000 in its third year. This forecast does not include advertising fees and web-link rates which will be a substantial income for the company. There are no direct competitors supplying this service at the moment so this company will be the market leader in this field with the potential to generate millions within 3-5 years. Last but not least depending the source of finance the company will aim to be setup or moved to a tax haven country preferably Gibraltar which means no taxes. f this sounds like a business opportunity which might interest you and u have no problem signing an NDA could you please contact me at lr3000@hotmail.co.uk or call me on 07533061665 so we can setup a meeting.

Wrote communications strategy which plans internal communications, PR and community engagement to achieve business objectives. Worked with tight deadlines and budget. Change communication through two major business restructures. Event management - leadership event for all management staff and quarterly â€œcanteen meetingâ€? events for managers to cascade company information. I proactively seek out news stories and create content for a wide variety of channels and write corporate communication material. Safety is a miner's first priority. In under a year I have doubled the rate of near hit reporting, which led to refinements to operational procedures and without doubt avoided injuries. I conduct focus groups with employees on a regular basis to find out if my internal communication methods and content are effective and relevant. On a daily basis, I monitor company media coverage and report that to the management team.

Two of Microdotâ€™s sleeve designs appear in Q Magazines top 100 record covers of all time. The mid to late nineties saw great diversification as many corporate projects for huge blue chip organisations were undertaken. Areas of specialisation include, but are not exclusive to, fashion, sport, entertainment and music, covering disciplines from packaging, branding, design for both print & web to corporate identity, advertising and moving image direction.

Records going back hundreds of years show that Bordeaux Claret has remained the steadiest form of investment even outperforming gold and oil. The wine market remains mostly unaffected by recession, interest rates and the stock market. The continuous rise in the value of fine wine is largely due to the limited availability of the wines, each vineyard producing fine wine can only produce a limited amount based on the quantity of grapes the vineyard can harvest in any given year, thus meaning over time prices are continuously being pushed higher and higher as more and more of a particular vintage diminishes from supply either

To that end I obtained a LLB Hons Law degree in 1998 and completed my LPC in 2000. My career route (due mainly to socio-economic factors) did not follow qualification as a legal professional but became rooted in customer service, claims handling and company secretarial work. Additionaly the company I set up also allowed me to work as the licensee of a public house whilst still enabling progress with customer service skills, human reource management, catering and hospitality, stock control, bookkeeping, VAT returns and business promotion; to name but a few. Thus following a period of field work in the customer service world and several temporary admin assignments I set up my own event and business planning, management and consultancy service as a basis to help individuals and small business owners. The remit of LES Pmc has continued to expand, to now encompass Business planning and management, Business promotion, Consumer assistance, and estate planning which includes Will Writing. The possibilities however are endless and I am always looking for new opportunities to make LES pmc better, so watch this space." , "headline" : "Business and event Planning management and Consultancy service" , "also_viewed" : [ "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jo-oconnell/51/b25/1a0" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/shaun-jones/39/8b3/888" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-haynes/21/852/a59" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kay-brook/31/507/3b6" , "http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhaynes" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jon-haile/2/6a8/628" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lloyd-pugh/3b/268/959" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andy-haynes/42/984/519" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/penny-phillips/22/298/919" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/carl-corbett/6b/455/809" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joy-richards/1b/30a/245" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kay-brook/3b/33a/55b" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/charlie-markwick/14/421/699" , "http://www.linkedin.com/in/ahaynes1" , "http://www.linkedin.com/in/andyhaynes1"] , "image_url" : "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/p/5/005/05c/257/12086cc.jpg" , "given_name" : "Andy" , "full_name" : "Andy Haynes" , "skills" : [ "Customer Service" , "PGdipLegal Practice" , "LLB Hons Law" , "Call handling" , "Call Centers" , "Research" , "Legal Research" , "Sales" , "Human Resources" , "Event Planning" , "Event Management" , "Social Networking" , "Events Coordination" , "Conference Coordination" , "Wedding Planning" , "Online Advertising" , "Email Marketing" , "Parties" , "Direct Sales" , "Food" , "Data Entry" , "Public Relations" , "Management" , "Business Planning" , "Small Business" , "Corporate Events"] , "experience" : [ { "end" : "000000" , "description" : "Small Business assistance, promotion and consultancy Service" , "title" : "Owner / Manager" , "start" : "201310" , "duration" : "000102" , "organization" : [ { "name" : "Les Business Services"}]} , { "duration" : "3 years 2 months" , "start" : "October 2011" , "organization" : [ { "name" : "Weston Wills"}] , "end" : "Present" , "title" : "Owner/Manager"} , { "duration" : "3 years 7 months" , "start" : "May 2011" , "organization" : [ { "name" : "Life Event Services"}] , "end" : "Present" , "title" : "Owner/Manager"}] , "education" : [ { "start" : "199900" , "end" : "200000" , "name" : "University of Bristol" , "degrees" : [ "Post Graduate Diploma" , "LPC"]} , { "start" : "1995" , "end" : "1998" , "name" : "Staffordshire University" , "degrees" : [ "Bachelor of Laws (LLB)" , "Law"]} , { "start" : "1993" , "end" : "1995" , "name" : "Farnborough College of Technology" , "degrees" : [ "HND" , "Legal Studies" , "" , "Business and Finance"]} , { "start" : "1990" , "end" : "1993" , "name" : "Weston college" , "degrees" : [ "A Levels"]} , { "start" : "1985" , "end" : "1990" , "name" : "wyvern school" , "degrees" : [ "GCSE" , "GCSE"]}] , "canonical_url" : "http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/andy-haynes/35/464/91a"}{ "_key" : "UK000583f8c23bc2cc" , "linkedin_id" : "99195126" , "also_viewed" : [ "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/juliette-binmoeller/61/943/768" , "http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lorraine-warne/16/2b7/3b6" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/theobald-de-bentzmann/59/a7b/997" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elizabeth-cook/78/726/964" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thanh-dao/26/772/605" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nomin-bat-erdene/7b/79/a8a" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pearly-jacob/22/943/9a3" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeppe-nybroe/5/425/5b5" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rob-tenniswood/12/492/9aa" , "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ansje-germann/29/278/706"] , "experience" : [ { "end" : "000000" , "description" : "I have nearly 15 years experience working in TV as a producer, p/d, series and exec producer, format developer and commissioner.
